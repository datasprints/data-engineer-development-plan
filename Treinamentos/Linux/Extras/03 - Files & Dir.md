### <a name="what-is-shell"></a>What is Shell?

Quoting from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)

>A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a traditional Unix-like command line user interface. Users direct the operation of the computer by entering commands as text for a command line interpreter to execute, or by creating text scripts of one or more such commands. Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal emulator, however, direct operation via serial hardware connections, or networking session, are common for server systems. All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration

* Interprets user commands
	* from terminal, from a file or as a shell script
	* expand wildcards, command/variable substitution
* Command history, command completion and command editing
* Managing processes
* Shell variables to customize the environment

### <a name="popular-shells"></a>Popular Shells

Like any indispensible software, Shell has undergone transformation from the days of basic `sh` shell that was used in 1970s Unix. While `bash` is default shell in most distros and most commonly used, powerful and feature rich shells are still being developed and released

* `sh` bourne shell (light weight Linux distros might come with `sh` shell only)
* `bash` bourne again shell
* `csh` C shell
* `tcsh` tenex C shell
* `ksh` Korn shell
* `zsh` Z shell (bourne shell with improvements, including features from bash, tcsh, ksh)
* `cat /etc/shells` displays list of login shells available in the current Linux distro
* `echo $SHELL` path of current user's login shell
    * The material presented here is primarily for interactive shell

### <a name="wildcards"></a>Wildcards

It is easy to specify complete filenames as command arguments when they are few in number. But suppose, one has to delete hundreds of log files, spread across different sub-directories? Wildcards, or also known as globbing patterns help in such cases, provided the filenames have a commonality to exploit. We have already seen regular expressions used in commands like `grep` and `sed`. Shell wildcards are similar but has fundamental and syntactical differences

* `*` match any character, 0 or more times
    * as a special case, `*` won't match the starting `.` of hidden files and has to be explicity specified
* `?` match any character exactly 1 time
* `[aeiou]` match any vowel character
* `[!aeiou]` exclude vowel characters, i.e match a consonant
* `[!0-9]` match any character except digits
* `[a-z]` match any lower case alphabets
* `[0-9a-fA-F]` match any hexademical character
* `{word1,word2}` match either of the specified words
    * words can themselves be made of wildcards

**Examples**

* `ls txt*` list all files starting with txt
* `ls *txt*` list all files containing txt anywhere in its name
* `ls *txt` list all files ending with txt in the current directory
* `ls -d .*` list only hidden files and directories
* `rm *.???` remove any file ending with . character followed by exactly three characters
* `ls bkp/201[0-5]` list files in bkp directory matching 2010/2011/2012/2013/2014/2015
* `echo *txt` for dry runs, use `echo` command to see how the wildcard expands

**Brace Expansion**

* `ls *{txt,log}` list all files ending with txt or log in the current directory
* `cp ~/projects/adders/verilog/{half_,full_}adder.v .` copy half_adder.v and full_adder.v to current directory
* `mv story.txt{,.bkp}` rename story.txt as story.txt.bkp
* `cp story.txt{,.bkp}` to create bkp file as well retain original
* `mv story.txt{.bkp,}` rename story.txt.bkp as story.txt
* `mv story{,_old}.txt` rename story.txt as story_old.txt
* `touch file{1..4}.txt` same as `touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt`
* `touch file_{x..z}.txt` same as `touch file_x.txt file_y.txt file_z.txt`
* `rm file{1..4}.txt` same as `rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt`
* `echo story.txt{,.bkp}` displays the expanded version 'story.txt story.txt.bkp' , useful to dry run before executing actual command

**Extended globs**

From `info bash`, where `pattern-list` is a list of one or more patterns separated by a `|`

* `?(pattern-list)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
* `*(pattern-list)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
* `+(pattern-list)` Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
* `@(pattern-list)` Matches one of the given patterns
* `!(pattern-list)` Matches anything except one of the given patterns

To check if `extglob` is enabled or to enable/disable:

```bash
$ shopt extglob 
extglob        	on

$ # unset extglob
$ shopt -u extglob 
$ shopt extglob 
extglob        	off

$ # set extglob
$ shopt -s extglob 
$ shopt extglob 
extglob        	on
```

Examples

```bash
$ ls
123.txt  main.c  math.h  power.log

$ echo +([0-9]).txt
123.txt

$ ls @(*.c|*.h)
main.c  math.h

$ ls !(*.txt)
main.c  math.h  power.log
$ ls !(*.c|*.h)
123.txt  power.log
```

**Recursively search current directory and its sub-folders**

Set `globstar` and prefix pattern with `**/` to search recursively

```bash
$ find -name '*.txt'
./song_list.txt
./bar/f1.txt
./bar/baz/f2.txt

$ shopt -s globstar
$ ls **/*.txt
bar/baz/f2.txt  bar/f1.txt  song_list.txt
```

### <a name="redirection"></a>Redirection

By default all results of a command are displayed on the terminal, which is the default destination for **standard output**. But often, one might want to save or discard them or send as input to another command. Similarly, inputs to a command can be given from files or from another command. Errors are special outputs generated on a wrong usage of command or command name

* `<` or `0<` is stdin filehandle
* `>` or `1>` is stdout filehandle
* `2>` is stderr filehandle

**Redirecting output of a command to a file**

* `grep -i 'error' report/*.log > error.log` create new file, overwrite if file already exists
* `grep -i 'fail' test_results_20mar2015.log >> all_fail_tests.log` creates new file if file doesnâ€™t exist, otherwise append the result to existing file
* `./script.sh > /dev/null` redirect output to a special file `/dev/null` that just discards everything written to it, whatever may be the size
* [explicitly override the setting of noclobber with the >| redirection operator](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/45201/bash-what-does-do/45203#45203)

**Redirecting output of a command to another command**

* `ls -q | wc -l` the 'pipe' operator redirects stdout of `ls` command to `wc` command as stdin
* `du -sh * | sort -h` calculate size of files/folders, display size in human-readable format which is then sorted
* `./script.sh | tee output.log` the `tee` command displays standard output on terminal as well as writes to file

**Combining output of several commands**

* `(head -5 ~/.vimrc ; tail -5 ~/.vimrc) > vimrc_snippet.txt` multiple commands can be grouped in `()` and redirected as if single command output
    * commands grouped in `()` gets executed in a subshell environment
* `{ head -5 ~/.vimrc ; tail -5 ~/.vimrc ; } > vimrc_snippet.txt` gets executed in current shell context
* [Command grouping](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Command-Grouping)

**Command substitution**

* `sed -i "s|^|$(basename $PWD)/|" dir_list.txt` add current directory path and forward-slash character at the start of every line
    * Note the use of double quotes to perform command substitution
* `file_count=$(ls -q | wc -l)` save command output to a variable
* [Command Substitution](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/CommandSubstitution)

**Process Substitution**

* `comm -23 <(sort file1.txt) <(sort file2.txt)` allows to create named pipes, effectively avoiding need to create temporary files
* [Process Substitution](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/expansion/proc_subst)
* [input and output process substitution examples](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/17107/process-substitution-and-pipe)

**Redirecting error**

* `xyz 2> cmderror.log` assuming a non-existent command `xyz`, it would give an error and gets redirected to specified file
* `./script.sh 2> /dev/null` discard error messages

**Combining stdout and stderr**

Assume that the file 'report.log' exists containing the text 'test' and non-existing file 'xyz.txt'

Bash version 4+:

* `grep 'test' report.log xyz.txt &> cmb_out.txt` redirect both stdout and stderr to a file
* `grep 'test' report.log xyz.txt &>> cmb_out.txt` append both stdout and stderr to a file
* `ls report.log xyz.txt |& grep '[st]'` redirect both stdout and stderr as stdin

Earlier versions:

* `grep 'test' report.log xyz.txt > cmb_out.txt 2>&1` redirect both stdout and stderr to a file
* `grep 'test' report.log xyz.txt 2> cmb_out.txt 1>&2` redirect both stdout and stderr to a file
* `grep 'test' report.log xyz.txt >> cmb_out.txt 2>&1` append both stdout and stderr to a file
* `ls report.log xyz.txt 2>&1 | grep '[st]'` redirect both stdout and stderr as stdin

**Redirecting input**

* `tr a-z A-Z < test_list.txt` convert lowercase to uppercase, `tr` command only reads from stdin and doesn't have the ability to read from a file directly 
* `wc -l < report.log` useful to avoid filename in `wc` output
* `< report.log grep 'test'` useful to easily modify previous command for different command options, search patterns, etc
* `grep 'test' report.log | diff - test_list.txt` output of `grep` as one of the input file for `diff` command
* [difference between << , <<< and < <](https://askubuntu.com/questions/678915/whats-the-difference-between-and-in-bash)

**Using xargs to redirect output of command as input to another command**

* `grep -rlZ 'pattern' | xargs -0 sed -i 's/pattern/replace/'` search and replace only those files matching the required pattern (Note: search pattern could be different for `grep` and `sed` as per requirement)
    * the `-Z` option would print filename separated by **ASCII NUL character** which is in turn understood by `xargs` via the `-0` option. This ensures the command won't break on filenames containing characters like spaces, newlines, etc
* [When to use xargs](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24954/when-is-xargs-needed)
    * has a good example for [parallel processing jobs with xargs](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/24954/when-is-xargs-needed/24979#24979)

### <a name="running-jobs-in-background"></a>Running jobs in background

Often commands and scripts can take more than few minutes to complete, but user might still need to continue using the shell. Opening a new shell might not serve the purpose if local shell variable settings are needed too. Shell provides the `&` operator to push the commad (or script) execution to background and return the command prompt to the user. However, the standard outputs and errors would still get displayed on the terminal unless appropriately redirected

* `tkdiff result_v1.log result_v2.log &` tkdiff, if installed, shows differences between two files in a GUI. If `&` is not used, the program would hog the command prompt

**Pushing current job to background**

What if you forgot to add `&` and using `kill` on the process might corrupt lot of things?

* `Ctrl+z` suspends the current running job
* `bg` push the recently suspended job to background
* Continue using shell
* `fg` bring the recently pushed background job to foreground
* `jobs` built-in command - Display status of jobs
* `nohup` command - run a command immune to hangups, with output to a non-tty
* [job control](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-bash-s-job-control-to-manage-foreground-and-background-processes)
